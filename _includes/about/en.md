Carpe Mentem is an anonymous blog that I created to share all my wildest ideas without the fear of social acceptance.

This isn't to say that I will be sharing only controversial opinions, or that this will be a racist/homophobic/antisemitic blog, just that I really don't want anyone to know who is behind it.

I hope you can find just one good idea that resonates with you from all my writing.
